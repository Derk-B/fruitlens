\section{How to use this?}

You should have stack installed (see \url{https://haskellstack.org/}) and
open a terminal in the same folder.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Download all the files from https://github.com/golbin/TensorFlow-MNIST/tree/master/mnist/data. Put these files in the root of the project. There is no need to decompress the files, our project will do that for you.
  \item To compile and run the server: \verb|stack run|.
  \item The server should then run on localhost:8080.
  \item You can send an image to localhost:8080/api/fruitlens as a base64 encoded string, we recommend using something like Postman.
  \item To run the training algorithm, run \verb|stack ghci| and load the NeuralNetwork.hs file. Then call the main function.
  \item The app is not finished so it is not available yet.
\end{itemize}
