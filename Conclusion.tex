\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
This project successfully implemented a Neural Network with convolutional layer support and a user-friendly web GUI for fruit classification using Haskell. The developed system, FruitLens, implemented a complete pipeline including convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected layers for image processing and classification. The system was enhanced with a RESTful API and web interface to provide user-friendly access.

Our implementation showcases Haskell's capabilities in handling complex computational tasks while maintaining code clarity and type safety. The optional CNN architecture effectively processes spatial information in images, making the model more robust against variations in input data. While we achieved successful classification of apples and bananas, future work could include implementing support for more complex CNN models to improve classification accuracy, expanding the dataset to include more fruit types, and optimizing performance with GPU support.
