# FruitLens
FruitLens is an app that can detect different types of fruit from the camera feed of mobile phones.

## Project structure
FruitLens requires an app that works on Android and IOS that sends the camera feed to a server that is running the object recognition software (ORS). 

The server should run an api that will receive the camera feed and sends it to the ORS.

The ORS will be written in haskell and will be the main focus of this project.
